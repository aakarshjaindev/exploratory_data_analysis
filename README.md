# Machine Learning Model Project

This project is designed to develop a machine learning model. It includes various components such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and exploratory data analysis.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files.
  - **raw/**: Directory for raw data files.
  - **processed/**: Directory for processed data files ready for model training.
  - **README.md**: Documentation about the data structure and contents.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

- **src/**: Source code for the project.
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: Functions for loading and preprocessing data.
  - **model_training.py**: Logic for training the machine learning model.
  - **model_evaluation.py**: Functions for evaluating model performance.
  - **utils.py**: Utility functions used across the project.

- **models/**: Directory for saved models.
  - **README.md**: Documentation about saved models and their usage.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies required for the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the `src/data_preprocessing.py` to load and preprocess your data.
- Train your model using the `src/model_training.py`.
- Evaluate your model's performance with `src/model_evaluation.py`.
- Explore the data and results using the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory.
