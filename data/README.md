# Data Directory Structure

This directory contains the data used for training the machine learning model. It is organized into two main subdirectories:

## Raw Data

- **data/raw**: This directory contains the raw data files that have not been processed. These files are the original datasets collected for the project.

## Processed Data

- **data/processed**: This directory contains the processed data files that are cleaned and transformed, making them ready for model training. The processed data is derived from the raw data and is structured to meet the requirements of the machine learning algorithms used in this project.

Please ensure that any new data files added to this directory follow the established structure for consistency and ease of use.
