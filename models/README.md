# This file provides documentation about the saved models and their usage.

# Models Directory

This directory contains the trained machine learning models used in the project. Each model is saved in a separate file, and the naming convention typically includes the model type and the date of training.

## Model Files

- **model_name_version.pkl**: This file contains the serialized version of the trained model. It can be loaded using the appropriate library (e.g., joblib or pickle) for inference or further evaluation.

## Usage

To load a saved model, use the following code snippet:

```python
import joblib

model = joblib.load('path/to/model_name_version.pkl')
```

Replace `path/to/model_name_version.pkl` with the actual path to the model file you wish to load.

## Model Documentation

For each model, ensure to document the following:

- **Model Type**: Specify the type of model (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network).
- **Training Data**: Describe the dataset used for training the model.
- **Hyperparameters**: List the hyperparameters used during training.
- **Performance Metrics**: Include key performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) obtained during evaluation.

This documentation will help users understand the models and their expected performance in various scenarios.
